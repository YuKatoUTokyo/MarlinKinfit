MarlinKinfit
------------

Kinematic fitting library for Marlin.

Currently two examples are available: 

- WW5CFit: This processor performs a 5C fit (px, py, pz, E and equal 
  mass constraints) on 4 jet events, as one would do for WW or ZZ 
  events. The center of mass energy and the name of the input jet 
  collection are steerable.

  The provided example steering assumes that you have an LCIO file which 
  already contains a collection of 4 jets per event. If you don't have 
  such a file, you have to call digitization, particle flow and jet finder
  before calling WW5CFit. 

- TTBarExample: This processor performs a 6C fit (px, py, pz, E and 2 W  
  mass constraints) on 6 jet events, as one could do for ttbar 
  events. To reduce the combinatorics it is assumed that 2 jets are
  b-tagged. The center of mass energy and the name of the input jet 
  collections are steerable.

  The provided example steering assumes that you have an LCIO file which 
  already contains two collections of 4 light jets and 2 b-jets per 
  event. If you don't have such a file, you have to call digitization, 
  particle flow, jet finder and b-tagging before calling TTBarExample.
