MarlinKinfit
------------

Kinematic fitting library for Marlin.

Currently one example is available: WW5CFit. This processor performs a 
5C fit (px, py, pz, E and equal mass constraints) on 4 jet events, as
one would do for WW or ZZ events.
The center of mass energy and the name of the input jet collection are 
steerable.

The provided example steering assumes that you have an LCIO file which 
already contains a collection of 4 jets per event. If you don't have 
such a file, you have to call digitization, particle flow and jet finder
before calling WW5CFit. 

Further information about the fit engine and the user interface provided 
in MarlinKinfit can be found at
