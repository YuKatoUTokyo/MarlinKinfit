MarlinKinfit
------------

Kinematic fitting library for Marlin.

Currently one example is available: WW5CFit. This processor performs a 
5C fit (px, py, pz, E and equal mass constraints) on 4 jet events, as
one would do for WW or ZZ events.
The center of mass energy and the name of the input jet collection are 
steerable.

The provided example steering assumes that you have an LCIO file which 
already contains a collection of 4 jets per event. If you don't have 
such a file, you have to call digitization, particle flow and jet finder
before calling WW5CFit. 

=====> ATTENTION !!!

Unfortunately the version installed on afs has been build without AIDA, thus the processor doesn't produce any output :(

To see some output, you have to copy the example processor (i.e. src/WW5CFit.cc and include/WW5CFit.h) to your working directory, rename it and build it locally with AIDA. Due to bug in the current CMake setup, you have to add by hand the MarlinKinfit/include directory to your CMakeLists.txt - here how it looks for DESY:
....

Hopefully this section can be removed soon.
